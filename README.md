# Rubiks-Learning-Robot (RLR)

RLR aims to solve a Rubiks cube in real life without human knowledge. 
We utilize a vision system to obtain the state of the cube in real time,
a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn to solve the bot,
and robotics to directly augment a real cube.

This is a project undertaken by members of Cornell Data Science:

Tobi Alade, Edward Gu, Eric Zhang, Skyler Shapiro, Vincent Fong, Kevin Jiang, Samuel Meisner
